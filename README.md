# Backblaze Operator
Unofficial Backblaze B2 Operator for Kubernetes

## Description
This project is a unofficial Backblaze B2 Operator for Kubernetes. It supports:
- Creating and deleting B2 bucket
- Set and update bucket ACL
- Setting lifecycle policy on bucket
- Creating and writing application keys to secret


## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against and Backblaze account.

Create a key on Backblaze B2 to use for operator - you can create Master Application Key or regular Application Key (with permissions to create new keys).
* to create Master Application Key, go to Account -> Application Keys -> Generate New Master Application Key
* to create Application Key, you will need to use [b2 CLI tool](https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-command-line-tools) (and you will need to create master key anyway).
```
$ b2 key create KEY-NAME writeKeys,deleteKeys,listBuckets,listAllBucketNames,readBuckets,writeBuckets,deleteBuckets
```
The output will be space-seperated `application-id application-key`

### Running on the cluster

**Using Helm**

To install a release named `b2operator` run:
```bash
helm upgrade --install backblaze-operator backblaze-operator \
  --set credentials.b2ApplicationId="your-application-id" \
  --set credentials.b2ApplicationKey="your-application-key" \
  --set credentials.b2Region="us-west-004" \
  --namespace backblaze-operator --create-namespace \
  --repo https://mgruszkiewicz.github.io/helm-charts
```
Replace `your-application-id`, `your-application-key` and `us-west-004` with details that match your account.
You can view all available values in [helm-charts repo](https://github.com/mgruszkiewicz/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/backblaze-operator).

### Example CRD Usage: Creating a B2 bucket

Creating bucket with lifecycle policies on prefix `/` and `/logs`. Lifecycle policies are optional.

```yaml
apiVersion: b2.issei.space/v1alpha2
kind: Bucket
metadata:
  name: my-b2-bucket
spec:
  atProvider:
    acl: private
    bucketLifecycle:
      - fileNamePrefix: "/"
        daysFromUploadingToHiding: 2
        daysFromHidingToDeleting: 3
      - fileNamePrefix: "logs"
        daysFromUploadingToHiding: 5
        daysFromHidingToDeleting: 7
```

### Example CRD Usage: Creating a application key

Creating keys with default permissions that will have access to bucket `my-b2-bucket` and will be saved to `new-key` secret in namespace `default`
```yaml
apiVersion: b2.issei.space/v1alpha2
kind: Key
metadata:
  name: my-b2-key
spec:
  atProvider:
    bucketName: my-b2-bucket
    capabilities:
      - deleteFiles
      - listAllBucketNames
      - listBuckets
      - listFiles
      - readBucketEncryption
      - readBucketReplications
      - readBuckets
      - readFiles
      - shareFiles
      - writeBucketEncryption
      - writeBucketReplications
      - writeFiles
  writeConnectionSecretToRef:
      name: new-key
      namespace: default
```
The secret will contain `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `bucketName`, `endpoint`, `keyName`.

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.
